* RNAseq viewer This type of app displays 3 interactive plots from an RNAseq analysis of human and mouse sarcoma cells. These plots are, MA plot, Volcano plot and a count plot, which is dynamically plotted by user click input. There is also an html table displaying the results of the analysis which can be queried, and interacts with the display plots above.
